# 6row_fw

My attempt at creating a QMK keymap for the 6row, a USB controller for the 6-row Lenovo Thinkpad keyboards. Based on the QMK files for the Discipline by coseyfannitutti: https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/coseyfannitutti/discipline and the matrix mapped by lowJ: https://github.com/lowJ/tp-keyboard

Accompanying PCB here: https://github.com/wren4777/6row_PCB

Status: QMK files complete, awaiting PCB to test.
