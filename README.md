# 6row_fw

My attempt at creating a QMK keymap for the 6row, a USB controller for the 6-row Lenovo Thinkpad keyboards. Based on the QMK files for the Discipline by coseyfannitutti: https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/coseyfannitutti/discipline and the matrix mapped by lowJ: https://github.com/lowJ/tp-keyboard

**Accompanying PCB here:** https://github.com/wren4777/6row_PCB

**Matrix:** https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tQ2VNZjKjTMB-WhVCuyUlhV_uuDBqxDxuXh8Zw81a1k/edit#gid=0

**Current status:** QMK files complete, awaiting PCB to test.
